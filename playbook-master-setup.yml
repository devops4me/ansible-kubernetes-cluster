# ######################### #
#
# This playbook will take a master node that has undergone the basic setup applied
# in the playbook-nodes-setup.yml and makes a single node the kubernetes master.
#
# The prerequisites are
#
#   - the playbook-all-nodes.yml has been run
#   - (either) there has been no attempt to make this node a master
#   - (or)     previous attempts have been reset with playbook-master-reset.yml
#
# Once you've checked that the master configuration you can then procedd to join
# worker nodes to the cluster with the playbook-worker-join.yml
