#
# This playbook will attempt to join any worker node into the cluster being
# controlled by the master node. The prerequisites are
#
#   - the playbook-cluster-nodes.yml has been run
#   - the master was successfully created with playbook-master-setup.yml
#   - (either) the worker/s have never attempted to join a cluster
#   - (or)     the worker/s have been reset with playbook-worker-reset.yml
#
# The master node is used to extract a join command which is then executed
# on the worker/s.
#
# A pre-check is to ssh into the master and validate that this command
# correctly produces a join command.
#
#    kubeadm token create --print-join-command
