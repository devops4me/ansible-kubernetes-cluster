# This playbook prepares every node to be part of a kubernetes cluster whether
# they are destined to be masters or workers).
#
# This playbook is designed to be idempotent so you can run it multiple times
# without needing to revert / reset with another playbook.
#
# The main pre-requisite is that ssh accesss has been setup and the hosts listed
# within the hosts.ini file.
